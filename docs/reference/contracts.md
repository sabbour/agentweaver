# Contracts, endpoints, and configuration

## Provider contract

`ProviderDescriptor` contains a `ProviderSeam`, provider ID, adapter version, options-schema version, hosting pattern, and advertised capabilities.

`ProviderRegistration` adds the enabled state, options revision, and selected schema version. A `PinnedProviderBinding` records the run, resource generation, and negotiated capabilities.

These records contain no credentials or option values. See [providers and models](../architecture/providers-models) for resolver limits.

`ProviderMeterSourceSelection` maps an explicit source to one enabled Cost provider.
`CostProviderResolutionRequest` requires an exact adapter version, options schema
and capability set. `ResolveCost` returns a checked `CostProviderResolution`
candidate, not a live resource or pricing result.

Projects & Config loads optional `ProjectsConfig:ProviderCatalog:MeterSourceSelections`
entries containing `MeterSource` and `ProviderId`. Native
`PUT /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/selection` accepts a Cost
`ProviderRequirement.MeterSource`; native selection GET returns that key in the
stored `EffectiveProviderSelection`. Both retain current owner authorization.
No new usage-writing endpoint, model-source authority, or pricing API is introduced.

## Orchestrator AGT Policy provider

`AgtPolicyProviderOptions` supplies an opaque resource ID and generation, an options revision and schema
version, and one or more platform AGT YAML policy documents. Every platform document must parse, default
to deny, and use only `allow` or `deny` actions. The provider is enabled as the platform singleton
`agt.dotnet-yaml`; project provider overrides are rejected by the shared resolver.

`AgtPolicyEvaluationRequest` carries a bounded opaque actor ID and action ID, primitive policy context,
and optional project policy documents. Each configured document is evaluated independently; every
document in both policy sets must allow, so project policy can only narrow. The adapter returns typed allow, deny, or error
evidence plus provider/options metadata; it does not consume grants, append journal events, or authorize
effects. The source-only `ExecutableActionGuard` validates an injected current grant descriptor and delegates
current grant ownership to `IExecutableActionGrantOwnerLookup`; no grant owner is wired in this slice. It
returns structured deny/error results for missing, stale, mismatched, expired, or unavailable grants and does
not invoke its protected callback unless the evidence append succeeds.
Caller bindings require one authenticated identity whose `sub`, `project_id`, and `run_id` claims share one
validated HTTPS issuer. The current grant descriptor must match that issuer and subject; a missing, duplicate,
or cross-issuer binding is denied before journal append or protected effects. The grant owner lookup remains
responsible for resolving fresh tenant membership and current grant authority; a tenant claim is not required.
## Orchestrator coordination owner

The `Agentweaver.Orchestrator` is an unpublished .NET 10 host candidate. Protected
coordination routes require an OpenIddict-validated bearer with one authenticated GUID
`sub`, one project/run binding, `api.read` and `projects.orchestrator` scopes, and the
route's configured audience. Each operation also revalidates current Projects & Config
authority and the accepted run selection; the caller's claims alone do not establish
current permission. Internal Events calls use the configured Events audience and the
same caller bearer.

| Method and path | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/root` | Accept the root session for the current accepted run selection and register it with Events & Sessions. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{parentSessionId}/children` | Register a child under the active parent and register the child session with Events & Sessions. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/messages` | Persist a fenced owner message and synchronously admit it to Events against the exact persisted outbox record. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/turn-boundary` | Advance the logical turn, claim and present the next eligible addressed message, and return pending parent notifications. A retry with the original state version returns the completed boundary result. A blocked session can resume only when a wake is pending. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/turn-completion` | Record an explicit idle, blocked, or completed turn state under the current fence and state version. |
| `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/notifications?limit={limit}` | Read unacknowledged parent notifications; the limit defaults to 50 and is bounded to 100. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/notifications/{notificationId}/acknowledge` | Acknowledge a notification belonging to this parent session. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/{messageId}/acknowledge` | Acknowledge a delivered message using its claim fence; receipt is not gate approval or work completion. |
| `POST /internal/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/message-route` | Events-only owner callback. Confirms the full outbound message matches the durable owner outbox, then validates active session relationship, writer, request/reply correlation, and current execution fences. |
| `GET /internal/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/coordination/sessions/{sessionId}/owner-binding` | Events-only current session binding for message claim, presentation, and acknowledgment. Returns `Cache-Control: no-store`. |

Configuration:

| Key | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings:Orchestrator` | Password-free PostgreSQL connection with an Entra runtime role. |
| `Orchestrator:Database:WorkloadIdentity:{TenantId,ClientId,TokenFilePath}` | Required runtime workload identity. |
| `ConnectionStrings:OrchestratorMigration` | Separate connection with the migration Entra role; used only by `--migrate`. |
| `Orchestrator:Migration:WorkloadIdentity:{TenantId,ClientId,TokenFilePath}` | Required migration workload identity. |
| `Orchestrator:Schema` | Optional service-owned schema name; defaults to `orchestrator`. |
| `Identity:Issuer` / `Identity:Audience` | HTTPS issuer and incoming Orchestrator audience. |
| `ProjectsConfig:AuthorizationContext:OwnerBaseAddress` / `Audience` | Trusted HTTPS Projects & Config owner and required audience for current authority and selection. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Authorization:OwnerBaseAddress` / `Audience` | Trusted HTTPS Events & Sessions owner and required audience for session registration and message delivery. |

Runtime PostgreSQL access uses the PostgreSQL Entra token scope and TLS
`VerifyFull`; the connection string must include the Entra role and omit a password.
Ordinary startup verifies the service schema. Run the executable with only
`--migrate` to apply migrations using the separate identity.

## Events & Sessions journal

The `Agentweaver.EventsAndSessions` service is an unpublished .NET 10 host candidate.
Its protected session routes require an OpenIddict-validated bearer token with a GUID
`sub` and exactly one `project_id` and `run_id` pair issued for an active core grant.
The accepted-effect project-fact route separately checks the receipt's original
issuer, subject, project/run bounds, and fresh effective project permission. These
are service-internal contracts, not public product API routes; tenant and platform
role claims are not required.

| Method and path | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health/live` | Process liveness. |
| `GET /health/ready` | PostgreSQL and current owned-schema readiness; returns `503` when the schema is absent or outdated. |
| `POST /internal/sessions/{sessionId}` | Resolve and pin the run's native Sessions provider, then create the session. A run reuses its immutable provider binding; a different binding returns `409`. |
| `POST /internal/sessions/{sessionId}/events` | Append an ordinary versioned typed event to the project/run journal. Returns `403` for every `PolicyEvaluation` payload until a trusted Orchestrator Core writer path is wired; ordinary appends return `201` for a new event, `200` for an identical run-scoped event-ID retry, and `409` if the ID is reused with different event content in that run. |
| `GET /internal/sessions/{sessionId}/events?cursor={cursor}&limit={limit}` | Read an ordered page for one session after an optional opaque cursor. Positions are run-wide and may have gaps in a session-only page. |
| `GET /internal/sessions/{sessionId}/events/live?cursor={cursor}&maximumEvents={count}&maximumDurationSeconds={seconds}` | Poll durable journal state and stream NDJSON `SessionEventDelivery` records, each containing the event and a reconnectable `nextCursor`. |
| `GET /internal/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/events?cursor={cursor}&limit={limit}` | Read a bounded, run-ordered page across all sessions in the authorized project/run. |
| `GET /internal/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/events/live?cursor={cursor}&maximumEvents={count}&maximumDurationSeconds={seconds}` | Poll and stream run-ordered NDJSON deliveries across sessions; each delivery includes a reconnectable `nextCursor`. |
| `POST /internal/project-facts/accepted-effects` | Append a project-scoped accepted-effect fact. The body contains only `receiptId`, `schemaVersion`, and `eventVersion`. Events fetches the receipt from the fixed Knowledge owner, requires the original issuer/subject/resource bounds and current `WriteProjects`, then commits the fact, project sequence, and inbox receipt atomically. Returns the persisted acknowledgment for new and identical requests; changed reuse returns `409`. |

Project accepted-effect facts have their own address and sequence. They do not enter
`session_events`, use or change a run's Sessions-provider pin, or represent a
session/run transition. The durable acknowledgment binds the receipt and contract
versions to the native fact ID, project, and sequence.

The `Agentweaver.Abstractions` contract provides `ISessionsJournal`,
`SessionSubscriptionRequest`, `SessionIdentity`, `AppendSessionEvent`, and a
discriminated `SessionEventPayload`; `Agentweaver.EventsAndSessions` supplies the
PostgreSQL implementation. Event version 1 supports turns, tool calls,
accepted decisions and effects, artifact references, and cache references. Event
version 2 adds a typed `PolicyEvaluation` payload; existing version-1 payloads remain
appendable and replayable. The generic run-scoped append route rejects every
`PolicyEvaluation` payload because actor equality does not establish trusted Orchestrator
Core writer provenance. The envelope binds project/run/session; the payload contains
bounded actor/tenant/step, grant reference/revision, purpose/action/fence,
outcome/reason, and provider/options identity metadata, with no arbitrary message or
credential fields. Other large payload content is represented by opaque
`ObjectKey` references; the journal does not store referenced bytes.

The run-level provider pin records provider ID, adapter version, options schema version
and revision, negotiated resource ID and generation, and capabilities. It is inserted
with the first session for a project/run and cannot be replaced by another create
request. Append, replay, and subscription verify the stored pin against the exact
registered provider and resource before proceeding; there is no provider fallback.
Run cursors are opaque and bound to the project/run; session cursors are additionally
bound to the session. Callers should return either token unchanged on replay or
reconnect.

The service also exposes protected internal addressed-message routes:

| Method and path | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /internal/addressed-messages/admit` | Accept an Orchestrator outbox message only after the Orchestrator validates the exact persisted message, current participants, request/reply correlation, and execution fences. Returns an admission receipt. |
| `POST /internal/addressed-messages/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/sessions/{sessionId}/claim` | Claim the next eligible message only while the current Orchestrator session binding is `presenting`. |
| `POST /internal/addressed-messages/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/{messageId}/present` | Mark the fenced claim as presented only while the current Orchestrator session binding is `presenting`. |
| `POST /internal/addressed-messages/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/{messageId}/acknowledge` | Record receipt under the current session and claim fences. A valid correlated reply makes its request `input_available` on admission; this acknowledgment does not approve a gate or complete work. |

The store writes messages with idempotency scoped to the sender run and session, a
per-thread sequence, journal reference, and outbox record transactionally. Progress
messages remain in sender history and are not presented as recipient input. Reply
threads can be derived from the correlated reverse message. The store supports fenced
delivery-state operations. Owner relationship and accepted-selection checks are performed by the
Orchestrator through current Projects & Config authority. Orchestrator admission is
synchronous; these source additions do not include a background delivery relay, a
gate-approval decision, or automatic AgentHost scheduling. See [the owner integration
and persistence boundary](../architecture/events-sessions#addressed-message-owner-integration).

Configuration:

| Key | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings:EventsAndSessions` | PostgreSQL connection for the service-owned schema and transactional outbox/inbox. |
| `Identity:Issuer` | Absolute HTTPS OpenIddict issuer used to validate caller tokens. |
| `Identity:Audience` | Required token audience for the service. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Knowledge:BaseAddress` | Fixed absolute HTTPS Knowledge owner URI for committed accepted-effect receipts; redirects are rejected. |
| `ProjectsConfig:BaseAddress` | Fixed absolute HTTPS Projects & Config owner URI for fresh project authorization; redirects are rejected. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:ResourceId` | Stable opaque resource identity used in the Sessions provider pin. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:DatabaseName` | Expected live PostgreSQL database name; negotiation compares it with `current_database()`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:ResourceGeneration` | Positive generation recorded in the immutable provider pin. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:Schema` | Optional owned schema name; defaults to `events_sessions`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:OptionsRevision` | Optional provider options revision; defaults to `native-postgres-v1`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:OptionsSchemaVersion` | Optional options schema version; defaults to `1`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:PollIntervalMilliseconds` | Optional live-poll interval from 50 to 30,000 ms. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Provider:ReferenceRetentionDays` | Optional object-reference retention from 1 to 3,650 days. |
| `EventsAndSessions:ProjectOverrides:{projectId}` | Optional project-level provider IDs permitted by the host catalog. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Messaging:OptionsRevision` | Optional native Messaging provider options revision; defaults to `native-postgres-messaging-v1`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Messaging:OptionsSchemaVersion` | Optional Messaging options schema version; the current provider accepts only `1`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Messaging:ClaimLeaseSeconds` | Optional claim lease from 10 to 3,600 seconds; defaults to `120`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Messaging:MaximumMessageLifetimeDays` | Optional message lifetime from 1 to 7 days; defaults to `1`. |
| `ProjectsConfig:AuthorizationContext:OwnerBaseAddress` | Trusted HTTPS Projects owner base address for current authorization context and accepted run selection. |
| `ProjectsConfig:AuthorizationContext:Audience` | Audience required on the incoming token when the internal owner client is called. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Database:WorkloadIdentity:{TenantId,ClientId,TokenFilePath}` | Required explicit workload identity for the runtime PostgreSQL Entra role. |
| `ConnectionStrings:EventsAndSessionsMigration` | Separate PostgreSQL connection using the migration Entra role; required only by `--migrate`. |
| `EventsAndSessions:Migration:WorkloadIdentity:{TenantId,ClientId,TokenFilePath}` | Separate explicit workload identity used only by `--migrate`. |

Both connection strings must omit passwords and name their Entra database role.
Connections use TLS `VerifyFull` and the PostgreSQL Entra token scope. The runtime
identity only verifies applied migrations and uses the already-created schema; it
cannot run DDL. Run the executable with only `--migrate` to apply embedded migrations
with the separate privileged identity. Ordinary startup verifies the service and
outbox schema and fails if a migration is pending. The service remains source-only: the repository does not include its deployment, a
Gateway route, automatic AgentHost scheduling, an active delivery relay, usage ledger,
or consistency-manifest workflow. See the
[Events & Sessions journal reference](../architecture/events-sessions).

For Knowledge promotion, the caller's existing bearer is forwarded when it is
audience-correct for both owners. If separate audience-correct tokens for the same
caller are already available, the caller may provide the Events token in
`X-Agentweaver-Events-Authorization`; Knowledge forwards its original bearer to
Events in a redacted request-only header so Events can fetch the receipt. Neither
token is acquired or persisted. The runtime does not provision these audiences.

## Identity broker endpoints

These routes belong to the unpublished Identity broker candidate. They are service contracts in source, not deployed product endpoints.

| Method and path | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /connect/authorize` | OpenIddict authorization request and external sign-in or consent prompt. |
| `GET /connect/authorize/resume` | Authenticated, single-use external sign-in continuation. |
| `POST /connect/consent` | Consent handle, approval, optional scope subset, local cookie, and `X-CSRF-TOKEN`. |
| `POST /connect/token` | Form-encoded authorization-code or refresh exchange. |
| `GET /diagnostics/whoami` | Bearer validation diagnostic. It is not an audience acceptance test. |
| `POST /secrets/redeem` | Validated bearer and exact secret ID, version, purpose, and run ID. |
| `GET /health/live` | Process liveness. |
| `GET /health/ready` | PostgreSQL connectivity. |

The service has no grant-administration HTTP endpoint. The browser consent UI is not implemented.

Broker access tokens contain the local broker `sub`, registered OAuth scopes, and resource audience. They do not forward upstream tenant or role claims and do not assign Projects roles. Projects & Config is the sole live owner of issuer-and-subject project memberships and resource-role assignments. Downstream resource services obtain current effective permissions through its versioned owner contract rather than maintain duplicate membership or role records or caches; OAuth scopes and signed project/run bindings constrain requests but do not create authority.

## Projects & Config authorization context

This route belongs to the unpublished Projects & Config candidate. It resolves only the validated caller's issuer and `sub`; it does not accept caller-subject or role selectors, issue grants, or mutate authority.

| Method and path | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/authorization/context` | Versioned current effective permission context, filtered by the validated audience, `api.read` scope, purpose, optional tenant selector, and project/run bindings. Returns `Cache-Control: no-store`. |

Contract version 1 contains the caller and selected tenant, current membership revision, optional project/run binding, and grouped effective permissions with their current role revisions. It omits assignment IDs and raw role rows. Purpose-bound tokens are denied; resource services must request fresh context for each privileged operation and must not cache or pin it.

## Knowledge and Memory

These routes belong to the unpublished `Agentweaver.Knowledge` .NET 10 service
candidate. Protected routes require the configured OpenIddict issuer and audience.
Each privileged request forwards its original validated bearer token to Projects &
Config for a fresh authorization-context check; Knowledge does not keep memberships,
roles, or authorization caches. Reads require effective `ReadProjects`, writes require
effective `WriteProjects`, and Memory-provider resolution additionally requires
effective project `ReadRunSelection`. If the validated caller token is already bound to
a project/run, those bindings must match the requested route and the authority response.

| Method and path | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health/live` | Process liveness. |
| `GET /health/ready` | PostgreSQL and current owned-schema readiness; returns `503` when migrations, tables, or required runtime grants are missing. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/records` | Create a Memory, SessionContext, or Proposal record. Requires one `Idempotency-Key`; a new write returns `201`, an identical retry returns `200`, and reuse with different request content returns `409`. |
| `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/records?kind={kind}&q={text}&includeInactive={bool}&page={n}&pageSize={n}` | Search only the requested project and agent, with bounded pages. |
| `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/records/{recordId}` | Read one record in the requested project/agent scope. |
| `PUT /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/records/{recordId}` | Append a revision using `expectedRevision` compare-and-swap and an `Idempotency-Key`; stale revisions return `409`. |
| `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/records/{recordId}/revisions?page={n}&pageSize={n}` | Read bounded immutable revision history. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/proposals/{proposalId}/promote` | Explicitly promote an owned pending proposal using its expected revision and an `Idempotency-Key`. The response includes `delivery` (`DELIVERED` or `PENDING`); pending delivery does not undo the committed promotion. An identical retry uses the same immutable receipt. |
| `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/proposals/{proposalId}/reject` | Explicitly reject a pending proposal using its expected revision and an `Idempotency-Key`. |
| `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/runs/{runId}/agents/{agentId}/context?q={text}&maxItems={n}&maxTokens={n}` | Compose bounded context with immutable revision references. Invalid narrowing is `400`; mandatory-content, candidate, or output budget overflow is returned explicitly as `413`. |
| `GET /internal/accepted-effects/{receiptId}` | No-store redacted accepted-effect receipt for the original issuer/subject and matching bounds, after a fresh current project `WriteProjects` check. Does not return proposal or decision content. |

The service owns a separate `knowledge` PostgreSQL schema. Revisions are append-only,
provider bindings are immutable, and current records cannot be physically deleted;
record changes use expected revisions. Proposal promotion checks current
`WriteProjects`, agent ownership, source run, pending state, and expected revision. It
commits the proposal revision, approved decision, redacted immutable receipt, and
Knowledge-owned outbox intent in one transaction. Events fetches the receipt and
appends a separate project fact; this is not a native Sessions journal event. Failed
delivery remains `PENDING` until a fresh authorized caller retries.

Configuration:

| Key | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `Identity:Issuer` | Absolute HTTPS issuer used to validate callers. |
| `Identity:Audience` | Required bearer-token audience for Knowledge. |
| `ProjectsConfig:BaseAddress` | Trusted absolute HTTPS Projects & Config owner URI; redirects are rejected. |
| `Knowledge:Events:BaseAddress` | Fixed absolute HTTPS Events owner URI for caller-driven project-fact delivery; redirects are rejected. |
| `Knowledge:Events:Audience` | Required Events audience for the already-issued caller bearer; a missing audience returns delivery as `PENDING` with the subject/audience tuple. |
| `ProjectsConfig:ProviderCatalog` | The catalog owner's startup snapshot used to validate negotiated provider metadata. |
| `ConnectionStrings:Knowledge` | Passwordless PostgreSQL runtime connection to the Knowledge-owned schema. |
| `Knowledge:Database:WorkloadIdentity:{TenantId,ClientId,TokenFilePath}` | Explicit projected workload identity for the runtime Entra database role. |
| `ConnectionStrings:KnowledgeMigration` | Separate connection for the explicit `--migrate` operation. |
| `Knowledge:Migration:WorkloadIdentity:{TenantId,ClientId,TokenFilePath}` | Separate explicit migration workload identity. |
| `Knowledge:Provider:{ResourceId,DatabaseName,ResourceGeneration,Schema,OptionsRevision,OptionsSchemaVersion}` | Expected resource identity and immutable provider options used during negotiation/pinning. |
| `Knowledge:Context:{MaximumCandidates,MaximumItems,MaximumTokens}` | Service-owned hard limits; each request can only narrow them and the current run's prompt-token limit. |

Both PostgreSQL connections omit passwords and use TLS `VerifyFull` with the
PostgreSQL Entra token scope. Ordinary startup verifies the already-applied schema and
requires the runtime identity to have only the necessary DML grants; it cannot migrate.
Run the executable with only `--migrate` to use the separate privileged identity. See
[Knowledge and Memory](../architecture/knowledge-memory) for ownership, context, and
current event-delivery boundaries.

## Identity host configuration

| Key | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings:IdentityBroker` | Identity-owned PostgreSQL database for runtime access. Use the separately bootstrapped Entra runtime role and omit a password; ordinary startup verifies but does not migrate. |
| `IdentityBroker:Issuer` | Absolute HTTPS issuer. |
| `IdentityBroker:Signing:PfxPath` | Mounted signing, encryption, and data-protection certificate. |
| `IdentityBroker:Signing:PfxPassword` | Deployment secret. Do not store it in source control. |
| `IdentityBroker:DataProtectionKeyPath` | Durable writable key-ring path shared by broker replicas. |
| `IdentityBroker:ExternalProvider:Authority` | Absolute HTTPS OIDC authority. |
| `IdentityBroker:ExternalProvider:ClientId` and `ClientSecret` | Registered upstream confidential client. |
| `IdentityBroker:Clients` | Registered client IDs, types, redirect URIs, scopes, resources, and secrets. |
| `IdentityBroker:SecretRedemption:Audience` | Required HTTPS audience registered as a client resource. |
| `IdentityBroker:SecretRedemption:VaultUri` | Azure Key Vault root URI. |
| `IdentityBroker:SecretRedemption:WorkloadIdentityTenantId` | Explicit Entra tenant ID. |
| `IdentityBroker:SecretRedemption:WorkloadIdentityClientId` | Explicit Entra client ID. |
| `IdentityBroker:SecretRedemption:WorkloadIdentityTokenFilePath` | Absolute projected token-file path. |

The host does not use ambient credentials or a development-certificate fallback.

## Identity PostgreSQL access

Runtime and schema migration use separate connection strings, projected workload identities, and Entra PostgreSQL roles. Both connections use passwordless async Npgsql token acquisition, `VerifyFull`, and the scope `https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net/.default`.

| Operation | Configuration | PostgreSQL role and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary runtime | `ConnectionStrings:IdentityBroker`; `IdentityBroker:SecretRedemption:WorkloadIdentityTenantId`, `WorkloadIdentityClientId`, and `WorkloadIdentityTokenFilePath`. | The operator-selected runtime Entra role has `CONNECT`, schema `USAGE`, DML on current Identity/OpenIddict tables, and `SELECT` on the migration history. It does not own the schema or apply migrations. |
| Explicit migration | Run the executable with only `--migrate`; provide `ConnectionStrings:IdentityBrokerMigration` and `IdentityBroker:Migration:WorkloadIdentityTenantId`, `WorkloadIdentityClientId`, and `WorkloadIdentityTokenFilePath`. | A separate migration Entra role owns `identity_broker` and applies migrations. Its workload identity receives no Azure resource role. |

The database bootstrap and reviewed grant SQL are operator-run steps. The ordinary host checks that the schema exists and no migrations are pending; it fails rather than creating roles or changing the schema.

## AKS Application Routing preview

`appRoutingDnsZoneResourceIds` is an optional deployment input. Empty input requests AKS's managed default domain. One to five unique existing public or private DNS zone IDs request custom domains and disable that default. IDs must belong to the exact authorized subscription, cannot name PrivateLink zones, and can use at most one resource group per zone kind.

The `appRoutingDomain` output has `managedDefaultRequested` and `domainName` fields. For an empty zone list, the template returns the exact `defaultDomain.domainName` from the AKS response. For custom zones, it returns `domainName: null`. The source does not construct hostnames or configure HTTP routes.

The `appRoutingIdentity` output is separate from `foundationProbeIdentity`. It contains the AKS-generated `resourceId`, `clientId`, and `objectId`.

| Role | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Key Vault Certificate User (`db79e9a7-68ee-4b58-9aeb-b90e7c24fcba`) | The existing Key Vault resource. |
| DNS Zone Contributor (`befefa01-2a29-4197-83a8-272ff33ce314`) | Each exact configured public DNS zone. |
| Private DNS Zone Contributor (`b12aa53e-6015-4669-85d0-8515ebb3ae7f`) | Each exact configured private DNS zone. |

The AKS source uses the Preview `2026-07-02-preview` API, enables the Key Vault CSI provider, and sets secret rotation to `'true'` with a `'2m'` poll interval. These are source definitions. No live role assignment, addon activation, domain, certificate, or route was verified.

## Azure operator command

The supported tool reads the exact subscription and tenant supplied by the operator. Deployment requires separate approval for its target and cost.

Run a non-mutating summary with `node scripts/azure/deploy.mjs` and reviewed target arguments. Add `--execute` only after approval. The checked-in parameter examples contain placeholders.

## External acceptance evidence

The Foundation Probe Job reports its resource-operation results, but it does not attest to its own pod identity, pulled image, or exit status. The separate read-only consumer observes the completed Job and pod, checks their ownership and workload-identity projection, and verifies that both the Job image and observed pulled image match the expected registry manifest.

The consumer validates the native probe receipt against the admitted source SHA, Git tree, deployment, identity, and target. It then queries Azure Monitor only after Job completion and requires fresh `AppDependencies` or `AppRequests` evidence correlated by source SHA, Git tree, nonce, trace, and span. Configuration checks do not substitute for this runtime proof; incomplete or mismatched evidence remains blocked. Local fixtures validate the consumer contract but do not prove a live deployment.
